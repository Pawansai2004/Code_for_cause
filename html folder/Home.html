        <h2>Which Farm Products Are Considered the Major  Agricultural Products This Year?</h2>
        <p>We may live in the digital age where technology is king, but we are still people who need to eat in order to survive. This means that age-old farm production and farm products are still vitally important to our society.<br>
            The landscape of agricultural products has shifted over the years. What once were the main sources of agriculture crop production may fade in favor of others as demand shifts. The livestock and crops that the typical American farmer is producing in a given year all depend on the current tastes, trends, value, and cost of farm products.<br>
            Exports also play a large role in agricultural products that are produced in the United States. For example, tree nuts are not in the top 10 ag products by receipts overall, but when looking at American agriculture exports (10/2019 to 3/2020), they’re number five.<br>
            With trade wars and the coronavirus pandemic, the last couple of years have been disruptive for agriculture in the US. But with all the changes the agriculture industry has seen, the need for the food American farmers produce remains strong.<br> 
            For this year, we have created a list of agricultural products that can easily be considered the major agricultural products here in India.<br> All of the examples of agricultural products on our list produce not only high yields but also high value.
            We will start this guide by explaining what agricultural products and agricultural production are and answering the question, “What are agricultural products that are most popular?”<br>
            We will give you a glance at farm production within the United States, the state of the American farmer, and take a deeper dive into agricultural product examples.<br>
            If you’ve been interested in learning which major agricultural products are produced and bring in the most money for agriculture in the US, this definitive guide to the American agriculture sector will provide you with that information and more.</p>
